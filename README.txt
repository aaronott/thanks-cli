What is thanks
==============
Rewrote this to include some classes. Again it is a very small quick script
that allows me to keep track of those people that I would like to thank.

Usage: ./thanks.php "User(s) to thank." "Action that was worthy of thanks."

Simple as that the thanks is swept away into a file.

For a little report

Usage: ./thanks.php report

NOTE: You will need to change the db dir settings but I like to keep mine in my 
Dropbox so it is accessible from multiple machines and all machines can write
thank you notes to it.

TODO: Write more tests
